== Description ==

Seamlessly Integrates [FancyBox](http://fancy.klade.lv/) into your blog: upload, activate and you're done. No further configuration needed.

All images on the page will be cosidered as part of a gallery, allowing you and your visitors to navigate through them with the [FancyBox](http://fancy.klade.lv/) interface.

The plugin will use jQuery to apply [FancyBox](http://fancy.klade.lv/) ANY image links that open an image. This includes images on posts, the sidebar, etc.

The requirements are that the link is on an image (i.e a thumbnail), and that it links to a JPG, PNG or GIF file.

[FancyBox](http://fancy.klade.lv/) will NOT be applied on text links, but i will to implement a configuration page to optionally customize that and much more in future versions.

Finally, i have only tested the plugin in WordPress 2.7, but it should work on recent previous versions. However, there's no reason why you shouldn't be already using WP2.7, is there? ;)


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `fancybox-moskis` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. See [FancyBox](http://fancy.klade.lv/) magically applied to all your image links and galleries.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= About future releases =

Future release will continue to work without having to make any configuration, but i will provide and options page to allow customization of the [FancyBox](http://fancy.klade.lv/) effect and changing where it is used.

= No worky, what now? =

If the plugin is not working or you find any bug/bad behaviour/conflict deactivate it and email me at jose (at) moskis.net with a description of the problem, and i'll take a look at it.

If activating the plugin somehow brakes your panel (cant imagine that happening but just in case) delete the plugin from the plugins folder and go to your blog panel.
